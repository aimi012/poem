        <h1>Today a story: </h1>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a woman who was sad. She felt lonely, lost and overwhelmed. No matter how hard she tried, the sadness stuck around and refused to leave her side. As she went through the days, it would weigh heavily on her and take away any joy that she wanted to find.

            But one day, something changed within her. She decided to take control of her life, and put in the effort to finally shake off her sadness. She began talking to friends, going out for walks, and doing things that she enjoyed. She spent less time dwelling on the negative things, and more time focusing on what she could do.
            
            The woman slowly started to feel better, and she could see the difference in her mood when she looked in the mirror. Her outlook on life had changed and she felt hopeful for the future.
            
            Each day became easier, and soon enough the sadness dwindled away completely. She had conquered the darkness, and a new light filled her life. The woman was finally free from her sadness.</p>
