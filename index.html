        <h1>Every day Poem: </h1>
        <p>On a cloudy day,
            The sky is so grey.
            We think of the peace
            That we could not keep.
            The world turns around
            But we are so sound.
            Our hopes unrealized
            And our dreams denied.
            We look up at the sky
            And realize how high
            We have set our sights,
            But nothing is right.
            Still, through every storm
            We should never forget
            That life can be beautiful
            And there's always hope to get.</p>
