        <h1>Today a story: aimi's thought </h1>
        <p>"Every day, he strives to convince her to trust him, determined to show her that he's not just killing time. He sees something special in her and believes she's worth his effort. So, he carefully balances his actions, not overreacting but doing just enough to build a foundation of trust. He knows that one day, when she finally trusts him, he'll treat her like she's the only woman left on this earth."</p>
